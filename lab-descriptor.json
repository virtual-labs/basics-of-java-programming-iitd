  "introduction": "Welcome to Core Java Programming Virtual Lab<br/><br/>Java is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used to develop desktop and mobile applications, big data processing, embedded systems, and so on. According to Oracle, the company that owns Java, Java runs on 3 billion devices worldwide, which makes Java one of the most popular programming languages. <br/><br/> It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA) meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<br/><br/>The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.<br/><br/> There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language: <br/>1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.<br/>2. It must be robust and secure.<br/>3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable.<br/>4. It must execute with high performance.<br/>5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.<br/>",
